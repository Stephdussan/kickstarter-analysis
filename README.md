# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

This project is a deep dive into the use of Excel as a data analysis tool. The dataset used contains several thousand crowdfunding projects. With the use filters, formulas, descriptive statistics and data visualization, trends are discovered to help the client make further decisions.

### Purpose

The aim of this project is to provide the client with an analysis of the correlation between crowdfunding campaign outcomes, their funding goals and their launch dates.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The main challenges encountered working on this project were the lack of previous experience in data analysis process and having to brush up on basic statistics. Gladly, several resources were shared both by the instructors and peers, which emphasizes the importance of team communication and collaboration both in the academic and professional settings. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  - Crowdfunding events are significantly more successful when launched in the summer, particularly in the month of May. 
  - Success rate is at its lowest when events are launched in December. May need to further study additional variables affecting success in this month. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - No events in this subcategory were canceled, regardless of the crowdfunding set goal amount. 
  - Almost 80% of events with a goal at less than $1000 were successful .
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - There was inconsistency in the formatting of values such as dates. Thus, some processing had to be performed for the data to be analyzed.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - It would be useful to have a visual on average donations by country and by category of event. This may help determine if more events within successful categories could be launched in those countries.
